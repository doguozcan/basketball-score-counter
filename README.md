# Basketball Score Counter

## About

The Basketball Score Counter is a basic responsive React application designed for basketball enthusiasts and developers. It allows users to track basketball scores dynamically with the ability to increment scores by one, two, or three points. Leveraging Tailwind CSS for its styling, this application serves as an excellent practice tool for refining skills with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, as well as enhancing UI design capabilities with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Score Incrementation**: Users can increase their score by 1, 2, or 3 points with the click of a button.
- **Score Decrement**: Ability to decrement the score by 1 point, offering a realistic score tracking experience.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Provides motivational messages based on the current score, enhancing user engagement.
- **Score Limitation**: Ensures that the score does not exceed 999 or drop below 0. Developers can play with the upper limit.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's `useState` for state management, showcasing an effective pattern for handling dynamic data.
- **Custom Hooks**: Demonstrates the power of React's `useEffect` hook for side effects, including updating the score message dynamically based on the current score.
- **Custom Button Component**: Includes a reusable button component with conditional styling based on props, enhancing the UI's interactivity.
